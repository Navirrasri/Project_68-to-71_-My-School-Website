    <p>We, at KURINJI are guided by this principle and also strongly believe that education is discipline
      for the adventure of life. True education is not a purchasable commodity. It cannot be bought and sold.
      Education is the apprenticeship of life. "KURINJI" blossomed symbolising rarity at Kavettipatty in Namakkal
      on the vast stretches of 18 acres in 2000. "KURINJI" co-educational institutions impart good standard of education
      for both rural and urban students.<br>
      Sri Venkateswara Educational Trust runs these prestigious institutions. Sixteen Directors who act as the Governing
      Body, put forth their untiring efforts and enthusiasm for strong establishment, good administration and steady
      progress of "KURINJI". Of course, KURINJI is highly blessed with well-qualified and efficient Directors to enable
      the teaching staff as the torch bearers of wisdom, especially in their subjects. So they are like the guiding
      stars to KURINJI students to score centum. We pride ourselves on our students' success and ability to get
      admission into reputed medical and engineering colleges state wide and shine in all walks of life.<br /><br />In
      1994 Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer
      Science (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. It was made up of companies that wanted to
      work
      together to create Web standards and also improve the Web. It was quickly agreed that the technology should be
      free of
      royalties and patents. Berners-Lee has served as director of this W3C since it was founded. In 1995 Microsoft
      produced
      the first version of Internet Explorer and this commercial browser created enormous growth in websites and web
      users.
      The Web was first used for e-commerce in 1997 <p>
